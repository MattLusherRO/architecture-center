| require a gateway to communicate with applications deployed via ARM. RBAC is not supported.  |
| ASP.NET applications.must be self-hosted or run on IIS in a container. |
| It requires ASE for dedicated VNet. Application can scale up to 20 instance. It requires ASE to go beyond that.  | Donâ€™t use to run long running operations. Decompose it into smaller functions that work together. |
